# 👋 Hello!

I am a Technical expert at **Huawei Technologies**, bridging the gap between theoretical algorithms and industrial-scale systems.

My research philosophy is summarized as **"From Biological Sequences to User Behaviors"**. I apply deep representation learning to decipher underlying patterns in data—from genomic sequences in my early career to billion-scale user behavior logs in commercial recommendation systems today.

Currently, I focus on building **Trustworthy & Scalable AI Systems**, with specific interests in:
* **Trustworthy RecSys:** Causal Inference, Debiasing, and Fairness (TOIS '26, AAAI '26).
* **System Efficiency:** Retrieval Architecture, Model Compression, and On-device AI (WSDM '26, KDD '24).
* **LLM & Agents:** Large Language Models for BI and Data Agents.
